# Email Configuration
# Option 1: Use Supabase Edge Function (set to true, then deploy Edge Function)
#   Note: Edge Functions require deployment. If deployment fails, use Option 2.
# Option 2: Use direct Resend API (RECOMMENDED - simpler, no deployment needed)
#   Set to false or leave unset to use direct Resend API

# From Email Address (must be verified in Resend)
# For testing/development, you can use: onboarding@resend.dev
# For production, REQUIRED: add your domain in Resend and use: noreply@yourdomain.com
# ⚠️ In production, emails will NOT be redirected (even if using @resend.dev)
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev

# Test Email Recipient (optional, for development only)
# When using Resend test domain (@resend.dev) in development, all emails are redirected to this address
# This is required because Resend only allows sending test emails to your verified email
# Default: beksultanggd@gmail.com (your verified email in Resend)
# Set this to your verified Resend email address if different
RESEND_TEST_EMAIL=beksultanggd@gmail.com

# Force Test Mode (optional, for production testing only)
# Set to 'true' to force email redirection even in production (not recommended)
# Default: false (production sends to actual recipients even with @resend.dev)
# RESEND_FORCE_TEST_MODE=false
