## 3. Necessity Test - Is this processing necessary?

### Is There a Less Intrusive Alternative?

| Alternative | Feasibility | Impact | Verdict |
|-------------|------------|--------|---------|
| **No personalization** | ✅ Possible | ❌ Poor guest experience, not industry standard | ❌ Not acceptable |
| **Opt-in only** | ✅ Possible | ⚠️ Most guests would miss personalization | ⚠️ Not ideal |
| **Opt-out (current)** | ✅ Possible | ✅ Good default, respects objections | ✅ **RECOMMENDED** |
| **Anonymous identifiers** | ✅ Possible | ❌ Defeats purpose of personalization | ❌ Not suitable |

**Conclusion:** Opt-out approach is the least intrusive method that achieves the business purpose.

### Why is Name Display Necessary?

   - Digital platforms should mirror physical hospitality
   - Expected by guests as part of service

2. **Service Quality**

   - Helps verify identity for order delivery

3. **Guest Satisfaction**

   - Creates sense of being valued and recognized
   - Improves overall stay experience

4. **Business Relationship**
   - Guest has existing booking/check-in (prior relationship)
   - Name already collected for booking purposes
   - No additional data collection required

**Necessity Verdict:** ✅ Processing is necessary to achieve legitimate business interest
